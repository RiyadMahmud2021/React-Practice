# Render Props

1. The term “render prop” refers to a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function.
2. A component with a render prop takes a function that returns a React element and calls it instead of implementing its own render logic. 
3. Render props are still really useful when we are creating highly reusable components that allow the consumer to render custom elements.
