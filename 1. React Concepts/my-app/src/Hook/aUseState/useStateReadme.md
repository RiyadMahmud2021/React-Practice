# Why useState??? and Some important basic things of React useState Hook,I have noticed....
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- "useState" related to taking/getting a state and updatingState function for updating state.  
               Ex: const [count,setCount] = useState(0); 
- We can use any "premetive data" or "array object" for useState argument (argument not parameter)
- "premetive data" is more preferable for beginner
- "array object" is difficult to implement and understand the code for a beginner.
-  Implemented argument," "premetive data" or "array object" " return two this such an state and state updating function.
